# Library website
I realised this project on February 11th, 2021, during my junior webdev training at BeCode.

## About
This project's aim is using Laravel 8, Jetstream and Tailwind to create a library administration system with admin and user access.  

## Technologies
- Php
- Laravel 8 framework with jetstream and blade templates
- Tailwind framework

## What have I learned?
- Create controllers (with CRUD), models and views in Laravel
- Create admin and user access with different rights (some views are shown to admins only).  After trying to 
  use 
  gates to restrict user access (the files are stil in the project), I decided to make this simple and do it another 
  way.  
- I learned a lot about `php artisan` and all its commands.
- I learned how to use MVC pattern correctly.
- I learned how to use Eloquent, Laravel's ORM.
- I learned more about Laravel and how it is organized in general.
- Learned how to use seeders for the database.

## Known Issues
- Website's CSS to be fixed.  

## To add
- Clients should be able to borrow books, for example with a shopping cart. An order is a list of books associated to 
a client, with an unique invoice number.
- Create a recap page for the orders.
- Create a genre table so you can add multiple genres to books (many-to-many)
- Create a client dashboard where they can see their past orders.
- Admins can see all clients order.
- Website's css in general
- Host the project
